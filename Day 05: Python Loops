The project for Day 05 will be password generator. Reason for this project is hackers easily gets into the account if easy
 or resused passwords are used.
 
Well,Using the same password on 20 different sites from Google to Facebook, to Skype, to Spotify,to all the random services that we sign up to.

The problem is that when one of these sites get hacked, then the email and password combination you used to signup is compromised.
So all a hacker has to do is try out those credentials on a bunch of other websites and see if they work. 

Now, we can easily detect if our email & password is on a database somewhere at this website: https://haveibeenpwned.com/
,type in your email to see if it was involved in a website that had been hacked.

Now, question comes of security, then you'll actually need unique passwords for each and every website.
And they should really be strong passwords, not 123456, or qwerty.

For help in generating strong passwords we're going to be building a password generator,strong passwords with letters and symbols and numbers. 


FOR Loop: looping through Lists. IT ALLOWS TO perform repeatitive actions in less code. One variable iterates through till the end of file or set condition reaches.

syntax: for iteration_variable list_name:
             indented statements

Example:

fruits=['Apple','Pears','Grapes'] #List of Fruits
for fruit in fruits: #iterating variable "fruit" iterates through fruit till the NONE reaches
  print(*fruits)
  print(fruit +" Hey") #type of iteraator is string & we can concatenate strings with strings only
  print(type(fruit))
print(*fruits ) # * unpacks the list items & gives list without quotes

output:

Apple Pears Grapes
Apple Hey
<class 'str'>
Apple Pears Grapes
Pears Hey
<class 'str'>
Apple Pears Grapes
Grapes Hey
<class 'str'>
Apple Pears Grapes

Average Height
Instructions
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

Example Input
156 178 165 171 187
156 178 165 171 187
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

Example Output
171

Solution: 1

student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()  #takes the string inputs & convert it to list
count=0
sum=0
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)): #running for loop from 0 to length of the list student_heights
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n]) #int type casting of list type range wise. if zeroth height comes it only converts this list type
  # print(student_heights[n]) 
  # sum=sum+student_heights[n]
  # print(sum )
  # count=count+1
  
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
  sum = sum + student_heights[n] #performs addition of the list int items
  
  count=count+1

print(f"Total height: {sum}")
print(f"Number of Students: {count} ")
average=round(sum/count)
print(average)

Output:

Input a list of student heights 11 22 33 44
Total height: 110
Number of Students: 4 
28

Solution: 2

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# print(student_heights)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height
print(f"total height = {total_height}")

number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
  number_of_students += 1
print(f"number of students = {number_of_students}")
  
average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(average_height)

Day: 05-02 Exercise:

Highest Score

Instructions
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

Example Input
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Example Output
The highest score in the class is: 91
The highest score in the class is: 91
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/DnSPgYNSTgeHRJ3MinHg

Hint
Think about the logic before writing code. How can you compare numbers against each other to see which one is larger?


Solution:




student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

max=student_scores[0]
for i in student_scores:
    if i >= max:
        max=i
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {max}")

#Commented Code:---------------
# print(type(student_scores))

# maxi=student_scores[0]
# for i in student_scores:
#     if maxi >= student_scores:
#         maxi=student_scores
        
# print(maxi)

# for i in student_scores:
#     s=student_scores[i] list out of index range because s=student_score[11] if list is of length 2 only
#     if maxi >=s:
#         maxi=student_scores
        
# print(maxi)
#Commented Code:---------------

OutPut:

Input a list of student scores 33 22 11 77
[33, 22, 11, 77]
The highest score in the class is: 77


Solution: 02:------------- It is better for all types of data types not just for lists

student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
  if score > highest_score:
    highest_score = score
    # print(highest_score)
    
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")

----------------------------------------------------------------------
In place of writing whole code for average & addition we can also use "sum" (does the addition of numbers)  function & 
"max"(finds out the largest number out of the given choices
function.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

--> FOR loop & the Range function:

for number in range(a,b):  #here we have created a range in between a & b & number will be iterating through them -> note that a to b but not including b
    print(number)

Example:

for number in range(1,10): # the range function will step through from start to end & will increase by 1
    print(number)

output:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
    
    
---> You can also specify the step in range function. Example:

for number in range(1,11,3):  #Now if we re-run this code it will output with 3 jumps or steps by 3
    print(number)

Output:

1
4
7
10

------> Day-5-3-exercise:

## Adding Evens

# Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Hint

1. There are quite a few ways of solving this problem, but you will need to use the `range()` function in any of the solutions.

Solution:

Method 1:

accumulator=0
for i in range(2,101,2):
  accumulator=accumulator+i

print(accumulator)

OUTPUT:

2550

METHOD 2:

#or

alternative_sum = 0
for number in range(1, 101):
  if number % 2 == 0:
    # print(number)
    alternative_sum += number
print(alternative_sum)

OUTPUT:

2550

---------> Day-5-4-exercise:

FizzBuzz
Instructions
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 
`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 
  `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
  `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
e.g. it might start off like this:

`1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz`
`1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz`
.... etc.

Hint
Remember your answer should start from 1 and go up to and including 100.

Each number/text should be printed on a separate line.

------------Solution:

for number in range(1, 101):
  if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)
