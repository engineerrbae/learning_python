The project for Day 05 will be password generator. Reason for this project is hackers easily gets into the account if easy
 or resused passwords are used.
 
Well,Using the same password on 20 different sites from Google to Facebook, to Skype, to Spotify,to all the random services that we sign up to.

The problem is that when one of these sites get hacked, then the email and password combination you used to signup is compromised.
So all a hacker has to do is try out those credentials on a bunch of other websites and see if they work. 

Now, we can easily detect if our email & password is on a database somewhere at this website: https://haveibeenpwned.com/
,type in your email to see if it was involved in a website that had been hacked.

Now, question comes of security, then you'll actually need unique passwords for each and every website.
And they should really be strong passwords, not 123456, or qwerty.

For help in generating strong passwords we're going to be building a password generator,strong passwords with letters and symbols and numbers. 


FOR Loop: looping through Lists. IT ALLOWS TO perform repeatitive actions in less code. One variable iterates through till the end of file or set condition reaches.

syntax: for iteration_variable list_name:
             indented statements

Example:

fruits=['Apple','Pears','Grapes'] #List of Fruits
for fruit in fruits: #iterating variable "fruit" iterates through fruit till the NONE reaches
  print(*fruits)
  print(fruit +" Hey") #type of iteraator is string & we can concatenate strings with strings only
  print(type(fruit))
print(*fruits ) # * unpacks the list items & gives list without quotes

output:

Apple Pears Grapes
Apple Hey
<class 'str'>
Apple Pears Grapes
Pears Hey
<class 'str'>
Apple Pears Grapes
Grapes Hey
<class 'str'>
Apple Pears Grapes
