 #Randomisation & Python Lists
 
 Randomness & quirky is useful when comes to gaming enviornment. It makes the games interesting.
 
 There's a whole bunch of maths that can be applied to create what are called a pseudo-random number generators.
 And the one that Python uses is something called the Mersenne Twister.
 
 #int random no.
 
 import random # this library stores the module random logic
 
 r=random.randint(0,1) #It will show random no. in between 0 & 1
 print(r)
 
 #floating point random number
 
 import random
 
r= random.random() #It will show random no. in between 0 & 1 but not including 1
 print(r)
 
 #show the random no. in between 0 to 5
 
 r=random.random() #It will show random no. in between 0 & 1 but not including 1
 r=r*5
 print(r)
 
 2. LISTS: Collection of data within square brackets which has a certain relationship with each other. Just like states in India comes under state relation. 
 list is what you would call a data structure.
 
It's just a set of square brackets with many items stored inside.And those items can be any data type. They can even have mixed data types like
you could store strings together with numbers or a set of booleans.It doesn't really matter.But what does matter is the syntax. 

In Python lists always start with a open square bracket and a closing square bracket.And then in between you have your items separated by a comma.
So pretty simple. In order to store it inside the variable,then its the same way as we've done before.

The only difference is the right hand side of the equal sign.This is the list data structure.

If we stored a bunch of fruits, for example,than it might look something like this: Cherry, Apple, Pear, separated by a comma inside a set of square brackets.

fruits = [Cherry,Apple,Pear]
