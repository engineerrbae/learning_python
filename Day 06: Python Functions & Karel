Functions, Code Blocks & While Loops

Functions are used to store the set of instructions for later use.

This is how we define the functions:

def function_name():  #It carries all the to-do tasks for the defined functions.
    indented statements
    
function_name() #this is the function calling. Responsible for getting the result from the functions.


Note That: Python is an interpreter so, we cannot call/revoke the function before it's definition /def part

In Day 06: In reeborg's world we do not have instructions to move the robot to turn right. So, you need to write the instructions for turn right.

Ans: def turn_right():
    
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
    
turn_left()
move()
turn_right()
move()

In next challenge, Angela asked to draw a square:

ans:

def turn_right():
    
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
 
def movement():
    move()
    move()

turn_left()
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_right()
move()

Exercise: 6-1-Hurdle Loop Challenge:

https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json

Try to write the shortest code.

Solution:

def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
def jump(): #Each step bot to cross one hurdle
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()
for i in range(6): #Total steps to cross all hurdles
    jump()
    
INDENTATION:

Spaces or Tabs? The age old question and the extent to which people obsess over this question,it really shows in this 2017 Stack Overflow developer survey,
where they are asked the developers, do you use spaces or do you use tabs?

And then they compare it against their annual salary and somehow have managed to show that the people who use spaces seem to earn a
lot more than the people who use tabs.

Now the official guide from the Python community is in fact to use spaces.

So if you click on the section, tabs or spaces,
they tell you in no uncertain words,that spaces are the preferred indentation method.And in fact, in Python 3,
you can't mix a code file that uses tabs and spaces for indentation in the same file. 

And it also tells you that in order to indent a line of code,it should be indented using four spaces,
so four hits of the space bar. 

Now,for a lot of people, that may seem quite inefficient because I have to hit my space bar
four times in order to achieve a single indent.
And you've seen how much we indent throughout our code. So it seems very,very inefficient.

But luckily in most code editors,they actually have a setting that allows you to indent using spaces,
changing the indent size to four.And when you hit the tab key,it will automatically insert four spaces.
