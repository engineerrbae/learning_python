Functions, Code Blocks & While Loops

Functions are used to store the set of instructions for later use.

This is how we define the functions:

def function_name():  #It carries all the to-do tasks for the defined functions.
    indented statements
    
function_name() #this is the function calling. Responsible for getting the result from the functions.


Note That: Python is an interpreter so, we cannot call/revoke the function before it's definition /def part

In Day 06: In reeborg's world we do not have instructions to move the robot to turn right. So, you need to write the instructions for turn right.

Ans: def turn_right():
    
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
    
turn_left()
move()
turn_right()
move()

In next challenge, Angela asked to draw a square:

ans:

def turn_right():
    
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
 
def movement():
    move()
    move()

turn_left()
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_right()
move()

Exercise: 6-1-Hurdle Loop Challenge:

https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%201&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle1.json

Try to write the shortest code.

Solution:

def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
def jump(): #Each step bot to cross one hurdle
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()
for i in range(6): #Total steps to cross all hurdles
    jump()
    
INDENTATION:

Spaces or Tabs? The age old question and the extent to which people obsess over this question,it really shows in this 2017 Stack Overflow developer survey,
where they are asked the developers, do you use spaces or do you use tabs?

And then they compare it against their annual salary and somehow have managed to show that the people who use spaces seem to earn a
lot more than the people who use tabs.

Now the official guide from the Python community is in fact to use spaces.

So if you click on the section, tabs or spaces,
they tell you in no uncertain words,that spaces are the preferred indentation method.And in fact, in Python 3,
you can't mix a code file that uses tabs and spaces for indentation in the same file. 

And it also tells you that in order to indent a line of code,it should be indented using four spaces,
so four hits of the space bar. 

Now,for a lot of people, that may seem quite inefficient because I have to hit my space bar
four times in order to achieve a single indent.
And you've seen how much we indent throughout our code. So it seems very,very inefficient.

But luckily in most code editors,they actually have a setting that allows you to indent using spaces,
changing the indent size to four.And when you hit the tab key,it will automatically insert four spaces.


WHILE LOOPS:

Until now, we know sort of two FOR loops:

1. one where we're looping through a list of items to do something with each item in the list,

 for item in list_of_items:
        #Do something to each item


2. other is using a range function where we create a range between a and b

and then we use every number in that range to do something. For example,

for number in range(a,b):
        print(number)

in this case would be to print it out. 

The while loop looks something like this:

while something_is_true
    #do somethinh repeatedly


when we have to use while loop to cross hurdle 1 using while loop it would be this way:

def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
def jump(): #Each step bot to cross one hurdle
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()
number_of_hurdles=6
while number_of_hurdles>0:
    jump()
    number_of_hurdles-=1

Now, have to write a while loop for reeeborg when you're not known with the final destination when it'll come. So, here we have it.

https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%202&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle2.json

Code:
def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
def jump(): #Each step bot to cross one hurdle
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()

while at_goal() != True:      #it will run till the time reeborg isn't at his goal. at_goal() is an inbuilt function for reeborg.
    jump()
    
    '''#WORKING CODE for hurdle 3
while True:
    jump()
    if at_goal():
        break'''

'''while at_goal() is not True:
    jump()'''
    
'''while not at_goal():
            jump() '''

Now, the question comes when to use for loop & while loop?

1. for loops are great when you wish to iterate over something and you need to do something with each
    thing that you are iterating over.
    
    So for example,if you're iterating through a list and you're saying for each fruit in our list
    of fruits and you want to be able to say, I don't know, do something with each of these items 
    in here. For instance,it can be as simple as just printing it. Well, then this will require a 
    for loop.

2. Use while loops when you don't really care what number in a sequence you're in, which item 
    you're iterating through in a list and you just simply want to carry out some sort of functionality 
    many,many times until some sort of condition that you set.

Another Reeborg's Exercise wherein we have no idea how many hurdles & movemeants will going to be there. All will be presented randomly. So, you have to write a program to suit all 
conditions.

Using these in_built() functions: # front_is_clear() 
#wall_in_front(), at_goal(), and their negation.  and if & while loop.

Program:

To write this program I reused the old function jump just removed the initial move() function it was ready to use for this program.
Going further I added the move() function only when reeborg find no hurdle & when it faces the hurdle it would have to jump it.

So here goes the program:

def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
def jump(): #Each step bot to cross one hurdle
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()

# front_is_clear() 
#wall_in_front(), at_goal(), and their negation.

while at_goal() != True:
    if front_is_clear() is True:
        move()
    elif wall_in_front() is True:
        jump()
 
 
 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 
 Now, coming to the challenge which I completed but code line was 43 & angela had asked to write within 23 lines. Damn! it was to simple to write the 23 lines of code. I made it too
 complex.In this challenge, the every hurdle's height is changing randomly that means no defined height.
 
 And program shall work for all the presented hurdles for rebborg's.
 
 https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%204&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle4.json
 
 I solved it by first writing the condition if there is no wall in front keep moving else go to the jump. In jump, I wrote the program for one side of the hurdle & then when I
 had to write for second face of the hurdle I wrote the another function.
 
 In second function, I specified, if front is clear move ahead else turn left & break. 
 
 Let me get my code first which I wrote before analysing that it's too complex & too long plus inefficient. Although, was working totally fine :D for all 4 hurdles. But, now I like 
 Angela's approach more:
 
 def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
 def second():
    move()
    if front_is_clear() is True:
        turn_right()
        while wall_in_front() is True:
            turn_left()
            if front_is_clear() is True:
                move()
                turn_right()
            else:
                turn_left()
                break
            
    else:
        turn_left()
 def jump():
    turn_left()
    turn_right()
    while wall_in_front() is True:
        turn_left()
        move()
        turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    second()
 while at_goal() != True:
    if front_is_clear() is True:
        move()
    elif wall_in_front() is True:
        jump()
 
 
 Angela's code: Just 18 lines & so understandable.
 
 def turn_right(): #it turns right
    for i in range(3):
        turn_left()
def jump():
    turn_left()
    while wall_on_right():
        move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    while front_is_clear():
        move()
    turn_left()
while at_goal() != True:
    if front_is_clear() is True:
        move()
    elif wall_in_front() is True:
        jump()
 
However, I am still happy that I got results on screen what I wanted to see. Now, I need to really work on code efficiency.
