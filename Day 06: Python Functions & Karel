Functions, Code Blocks & While Loops

Functions are used to store the set of instructions for later use.

This is how we define the functions:

def function_name():  #It carries all the to-do tasks for the defined functions.
    indented statements
    
function_name() #this is the function calling. Responsible for getting the result from the functions.


Note That: Python is an interpreter so, we cannot call/revoke the function before it's definition /def part

In Day 06: In reeborg's world we do not have instructions to move the robot to turn right. So, you need to write the instructions for turn right.

Ans: def turn_right():
    
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
    
turn_left()
move()
turn_right()
move()

In next challenge, Angela asked to draw a square:

ans:

def turn_right():
    
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    
 
def movement():
    move()
    move()

turn_left()
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_right()
move()
