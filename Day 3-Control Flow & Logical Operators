##Day 3-Control Flow & Logical Operators

#Control FLow: Decision Making

For this particularly, we use if-else statements which finalises the decision. It is similar to when you have to decide one result out of the two.

Syntax:

if condition:
  pass        -> the decision has to be placed in indentation block.
else condition:  -> condition writing is optional
  print("I am an else block") -> the decision has to be placed in indentation block.

Please note that the if-else are pairs so they both follow the same indentation line. As shown above.

#Comparison Operators:

1. >   ( Greater than )
2. <   ( Less than )  
3. >=  ( Greater than or equal to )
4. =<  ( Less than or equal to )
5. ==  ( Equal to ) -> Checking to see the quality it is not similar to assignment operator (=)
6. !=  ( Not Equal to )

Exercise 3.1: 

## Odd or Even

# Instructions

Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number. 

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder. 

e.g. 86 is **even** because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The **modulo** is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division. 

e.g. 

6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder. 

```
6 % 2 = 0
```

5 Ã· 2 = 2 x **2** + 1, remainder is 1.

```
5 % 2 = 1
```

14 Ã· 4 = 3 x **4** + 2, remainder is 2.

```
14 % 4 = 2

SOlution:

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#First *fork* your copy. Then copy-paste your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#Finally click "Run" to execute the tests

if (number%2==0):
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")
  
#Nested if-else

if condition: ( This has to be true in order to go to the next conditional block of if else )
 if condition:
   pass
 else:
   print("do this")
else condition:
  print("do this")
